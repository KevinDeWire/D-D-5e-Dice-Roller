# D-D-5e-Dice-Roller
This is a dice rolling app for Android.
It was created using Visual Studio and Xamarin and is written in C#.

This project was created as part of a Mobile App Development course.
I play D&D and I love random number generators.  So, I created an app to replace dice at the table.

Currently it contains activities for rolling d20s, damage, and percentiles.

It is too large at this point (about 10 MB). This is because I have seperate images for each of the d20 sides and percentile dice sides.
I have a plan to overlay text on a single non-changing image, this should reduce the overall size of the file.
